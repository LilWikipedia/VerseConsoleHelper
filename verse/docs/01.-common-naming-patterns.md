# 01. Common Naming Patterns

Naming is crucial for readable and maintainable code. Try to be consistent in the naming style throughout your code.

## **1.1 Do**

* `IsX`: Often used for naming logic variables to ask a question (for example, `IsEmpty`).
* `OnX`: An overloadable function called by the framework.
* `SubscribeX`: Subscribe to framework event named X, often passing an `OnX` function to it.
* `MakeC`: Make an instance of class c without overloading the c constructor.
* `CreateC`: Create an instance of class c, beginning its logical lifetime.
* `DestroyC`: End the logic lifetime.
* `C:c`: If you’re working with a single instance of class c, it’s fine to call it C.

## **1.2 Don’t**

* Decorate type names. Just call it `thing`, not `thing_type` or `thing_class`.
* Decorate enumeration values. Not `color := enum{COLOR_Red, COLOR_Green}`, use `color := enum{Red, Green}`.
