# 04. Functions

### 4.1 Implicit return by default

*   Functions return their last expression value. Use that as an implicit return.

    ```csharp
    Sqr(X:int):int =

         X * X # Implicit return
    ```
* If using any explicit returns, all returns in the function should be explicit.

### 4.2 GetX functions should be

*   Getters or functions with similar semantics that may fail to return valid values should be marked `<decides><transacts>` and return a non-option type. The caller should handle potential failure.

    ```csharp
    GetX()<decides><transacts>:x
    ```
* An exception is functions that need to unconditionally write to a `var`. Failure would roll the mutation back, so they need to use `logic` or `option` for their return type.

### 4.3 Prefer Extension Methods to Single Parameter Functions

* Use extension methods instead of a function with a single typed parameter.

Doing this helps Intellisense. By typing&#x20;

* `MyVector.Normalize()`  instead of `Normalize(MyVector)`&#x20;

it can suggest names with each character of the method name you type. For example:

```csharp
 (Vector:vector3).Normalize<public>():vector3
```

Do not:

```csharp
  Normalize<public>(Vector:vector3):vector3
```
