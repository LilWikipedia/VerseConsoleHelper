# 02. Names

## 2.1 Types use lower\_snake\_case

Type names should always be lower\_snake\_case. This includes all types: structs, classes, typedefs, traits/interfaces, enums, etc.

`my_new_type := class`

## 2.2 Interfaces are adjectives

Interfaces should be adjectives where possible, such as printable, enumerable. Where adjectives don’t seem right, append `_interface` to the name instead.

`my_new_thing_interface := interface`

## 2.3 PascalCase everything else

All other names should be PascalCase. Modules, member variables, parameters, methods, and so on.

`MyNewVariable:my_new_type = …`

## 2.4 Parametric Types

* Name parametric types t or thing, where thing explains what the type is supposed to represent. For example: `Send(Payload:payload where payload:type)` You’re sending some parameterized data, `Payload`, of any `payload` type.
* If there’s more than one parametric type, avoid using single letters, such as `t`, `u`, `g`
* Never use `_t` suffix.
