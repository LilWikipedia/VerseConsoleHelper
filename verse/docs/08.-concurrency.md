description: 8.1 Don’t Decorate Functions with Async
---

# 08. Concurrency

* Avoid decorating `<suspends>` functions with `Async` or similar terms.
*   Do:

    ```
    DoWork()<suspends>:void
    ```
*   Don't:

    ```
    DoWorkAsync()<suspends>:void
    ```
*   It’s acceptable to add the `Await` prefix to a `<suspends>` function that internally waits on something to happen. This can clarify how an API is supposed to be used.

    ```
    AwaitGameEnd()<suspends>:void=
      # Setup other things before awaiting game end…
        GameEndEvent.Await()

    OnBegin()<suspends>:void =
        race:
            RunGameLoop()
            AwaitGameEnd()
    ```
