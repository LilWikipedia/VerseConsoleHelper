## creative\_devices

### animation\_controller

* Animation := module:
* Module import path: `/Fortnite.com/Devices/Animation`

`CreativeAnimation<public> := module:`

* A structure for defining [Bezier interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier\_curve) parameters.

`cubic_bezier_parameters<native><public> := struct<computes>:`

* X value of the P1 control point. `0.0 <= X0 <= 1.0` or an error will be generated when calling `animation_controller.SetAnimation`.

`X0<native><public>:float = external {}`

* Y value of the P1 control point.

`Y0<native><public>:float = external {}`

* X value of the P2 control point. `0.0 <= X1 <= 1.0` or an error will be generated when calling `animation_controller.SetAnimation`.

`X1<native><public>:float = external {}`

* Y value of the P2 control point.

`Y1<native><public>:float = external {}`

* Convenience interpolation modes. These built in modes are based on the [CSS animation standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/)

#### Interpolation Types

* Convenience interpolation modes. These built in modes are based on the [CSS animation standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/)
* `Linear` animations move at a constant speed.

`Linear<public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* `Ease` animations start slowly, speed up, then end slowly. The speed of the animation is slightly slower at the end than the start.

`Ease<public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* `EaseIn` animations start slow, then speed up towards the end.

`EaseIn<public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* `EaseOut` animations start fast, then slow down towards the end.

`EaseOut<public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* `EaseInOut` animations are similar to `Ease` but the start and end animation speed is symmetric.

`EaseInOut<public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* Instead of specifying the actual keyframe positions, we specify the keyframe deltas. This allows us to treat the initial position of the prop as keyframe 0 and avoid the question of how to get the prop to its initial location. For a `animation_mode.Loop` animation, the net rotation and translation must both be zero. Each delta is interpreted as a world-space transformation to be concatenated onto the previous transform(s).

`keyframe_delta<native><public> := struct:`

* Target position of the `creative_prop`. This is a world-space coordinate in cm, with the initial position of the `creative_prop` acting as coordinate (0,0).

`DeltaLocation<native><public>:vector3`

* Target rotation for the `creative_prop`. Rotations are relative to the starting rotation of the `creative_prop`

`DeltaRotation<native><public>:rotation`

* Target scale for the `creative_prop`. Scale is multiplicative to the starting Scale of the `creative_prop`

`DeltaScale<native><public>:vector3 = external {}`

* Time in seconds the `creative_prop` should animate between its last frame and this frame.

`Time<native><public>:float`

* Interpolation mode for this `keyframe_delta`
* Default = `InterpolationTypes.Linear`

`Interpolation<native><public>:cubic_bezier_parameters = external {}`

* Animation play modes.

`animation_mode<native><public> := enum:`

* Stop after playing the animation once.

`OneShot`

* Reverse direction after reaching the final `keyframe_delta`, then play the animation in reverse.

`PingPong`

* Play the animation in a loop. This requires the animation ends exactly where it began.

`Loop`

* `animation_controller` states.

`animation_controller_state<native><public> := enum:`

* The target of the animation is not an animatable prop. This could be because:
* It is not a `creative_prop` that can be animated.
* It was disposed or otherwise destroyed.
* It has the 'Register with Structural Grid' option set in UEFN.

`InvalidObject`

* No animation has been successfully set via `animation_controller.SetAnimation`, or that animation has been cleared by a failed call to `animation_controller.SetAnimation`

`AnimationNotSet`

* Animation has either never started, finished, or was explicitly stopped.

`Stopped`

* Animation is playing.

`Playing`

* Animation is paused.

`Paused`

* Results for `animation_controller.AwaitNextKeyframe` function.

`await_next_keyframe_result<native><public> := enum:`

* The next keyframe has been reached successfully.

`KeyframeReached`

* No animation is currently playing and this function call has returned immediately.

`NotPlaying`

* The animation was canceled either due to the object being destroyed, becoming invalid, or because it was moved via some other API.

`AnimationAborted`

* Used to move and animate the position of `creative_prop` objects.
* See `creative_prop.GetAnimationController` for information on acquiring an instance of an `animation_controller` for a given `creative_prop`.
* See `SetAnimation` for details on authoring movement and animations.

`animation_controller<native><public> := class<epic_internal>:`

* Suspends at the callsite until the next `keyframe_delta` is finished. This will also return if the animation is aborted or not playing. See `await_next_keyframe_result` if your code needs to take different paths based on why `AwaitNextKeyframe` returned.

`AwaitNextKeyframe<native><public>()<suspends>:await_next_keyframe_result`

* Starts or resumes playback of the animation.

`Play<public>():void = external {}`

* Pauses the animation if it is already playing.

`Pause<public>():void = external {}`

* Stops playback and resets the animation to the first keyframe. Also resets the prop transform. Calling this method is valid while the animation is in the `Playing` or `Paused` states.

`Stop<public>():void = external {}`

* Returns the current state of this `animation_controller`.

`GetState<native><public>()<transacts>:animation_controller_state`

`IsValid<native><public>()<transacts><decides>:void`

* Sets the animation for the `animation_controller`. Animations are processed in the order provided in `Keyframes`.

`SetAnimation<public>(Keyframes:[]keyframe_delta, ?Mode:animation_mode):void = external {}`

* Signaled each time a keyframe is reached. Callback(KeyframeIndex:int, InReverse:logic). Note that the KeyframeIndex in the callback is generally in \[1, NumDeltaKeyframes] except that in a `PingPong` animation the final keyframe played in reverse is identified as index 0. This is because `SetAnimation` takes delta keyframes whereas this event notifies the listener that a specific keyframe has been reached.

`KeyframeReachedEvent<native><public>:listenable(tuple(int, logic)) = external {}`

* Signaled when the entire animation is complete. This will only fire for `OneShot` animations.

`MovementCompleteEvent<native><public>:listenable(tuple()) = external {}`

* Signaled when the state has changed. Use `GetState` to get the new state.

`StateChangedEvent<native><public>:listenable(tuple()) = external {}`

* Returns an `animation_controller` used to animate `Prop`. Only a subset of `creative_prop` types can be animated, though this may change in the future. A few examples of props that cannot be animated yet are: Walls attached to buildings, treasure chests, and Llamas.

### TeleportTo

* Teleports this `fort_character` to the provided `Position` and applies the yaw of `Rotation`. Will fail if the `Position` specified is e.g. outside of the playspace or specifies a place where the character cannot fit.

`TeleportTo<public>(Position:vector3, Rotation:rotation)<transacts><decides>:void`

* Returns the `fort_character` for `InAgent`. Fails if `InAgent` is not a `fort_character`. `(InAgent:agent).GetFortCharacter<native><public>()<transacts><decides>:fort_character`
