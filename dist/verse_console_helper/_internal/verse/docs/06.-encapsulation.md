# 06. Encapsulation

### 6.1 Prefer Interfaces to Classes

* Use interfaces instead of classes where reasonable. This helps reduce implementation dependencies and allows users to provide implementations that can be used by the framework.

### 6.2 Prefer Private Access and Restrict Scope

* Class members should be 'private' in most cases.
* Class and module methods should be scoped as restrictively as possible - `<internal>` or `<private>` where appropriate.
