# 13. Containers

Store multiple values together by using a container . Verse has a number of container types to store values in.

## Option

* The `option` type can contain one value or can be empty.
* In the following example, `MaybeANumber` is an optional integer `?int` that contains no value, A new value for `MaybeANumber` is then set to `42`.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
var MaybeANumber : ?int = false # unset optional value
set MaybeANumber := option{42} # assigned the value 42
```
{% endcode %}

### Initialization

You can initialize an option with one of the following:

* **No value:** Assign `false` to the option to mark it as unset.
* **Initial value:** Use the keyword `option` followed by `{}`, and an expression between the `{}`. If the expression fails, the option will be unset and have the value `false`.
* Specify the type by adding `?` before the type of value expected to be stored in the option. For example `?int`.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
MaybeANumber : ?int = option{42} # initialized as 42
 
MaybeAnotherNumber : ?int = false # unset optional value
```
{% endcode %}
