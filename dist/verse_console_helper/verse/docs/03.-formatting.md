# 03. Formatting

It is important to stay consistent with formatting throughout your codebase. This makes the code easier to read and understand for yourself and other developers. Choose a formatting style that works for the project.

As an example of staying consistent, you could choose one of the following spacing formats and use it throughout the codebase:

* `MyVariable : int = 5`
* `MyVariable:int = 5`

## 3.1 Indentation

Use four spaces for indentation, never tabs. Code blocks should use indented blocks (spaced) rather than curly brackets (braced):

Except when writing single line expressions like `option{a}`, `my_class{A := b}`, etc.

## 3.2 Spaces

Use spaces around operators, unless it makes sense to keep the code compact for its context. Add braces to explicitly define the order of operations.

`MyNumber := 4 + (2 * (a + b))`

Donâ€™t add spaces at the beginnings and ends of brackets. Multiple expressions inside brackets should be separated by a single space.

Keep identifier and type together; add a space around the assignment `=` operator. Add a space around type definitions and constant initialization operators (`:=`).

* `MyVariable:int = 5`
* `MyVariable := 5`
* `my_type := class`

Follow the same recommendations for brackets, identifiers, and types spacing for function signatures. ![3-3C](https://github.com/LilWikipedia/UEFNVersePocketWiki/assets/78571191/097ed183-b7a7-4f22-8ffa-e7bdc802fae2)

## 3.3 Line Breaks

* Use a spaced, multiline form to insert a line break. For example:

![LINE](https://github.com/LilWikipedia/UEFNVersePocketWiki/assets/78571191/1afb31d0-2b71-4118-856b-ab50cbcdddb4)

* DO NOT use a single line, example:

`MyTransform := transform{Translation := vector3{X := 100.0, Y := 200.0, Z := 300.0}, Rotation := rotation{...}}`

* Define enums in spaced, multiline form if they need per-enumeration comments or if you need to insert a line break.

`enum:`

`Red, # Desc1`

`Blue, # Desc2`

## 3.4 Brackets

* Only use brackets for inheriting class definitions. For example:

`my_base_type := class:`

* Do NOT use this styling:

`my_base_type := class():`

## 3.5 Avoid Dot-Space Notation

* Avoid using dot-space ". " notation in place of braces. This makes it visually harder to parse whitespace and is a potential source of confusion.
